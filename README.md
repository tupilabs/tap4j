# Test Anything Protocol

TAP is a test protocol that can be used to report test execution. It has been 
created with Perl 1, around 1988, and is the main format in Perl. A test 
harness executes tests and generates TAP, in the same way that a test harness 
can execute tests and generate other formats such as TestNG, JUnit or SubUnit.

TAP can be extended, what is not true with TestNG and JUnit. 
There is a specification for the protocol where, by using YAML(ish), you can 
include extra information about your tests, such as attachments.
