tap4j

 tap4j is an implementation of the TAP - <<Test Anything Protocol>> - for <<Java>>. 
 TAP is a standard way to document test execution. There are two main roles in 
 TAP, a producer and a consumer.

 The <<TAP Producer>> is responsible for producing a <TAP Stream>. Usually the TAP Stream is written to a file.
 The following is an example of a TAP Stream.
