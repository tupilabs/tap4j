TAP Consumer

 A TAP Consumer can interpret the output of a TAP Producer to determine how 
 many tests were run, which tests succeedded, and which dianostic information 
 might be usefully reported to the user. In tap4j the consumers are created 
 using the class {{{http://tap4j.sourceforge.net/apidocs/org/tap4j/consumer/TapConsumerFactory.html}TapConsumerFactory}}.

TapConsumer consumer = TapConsumerFactory.makeTap13Consumer();
TapConsumer consumer = TapConsumerFactory.makeTap13YamlConsumer();
TapConsumer consumer = TapConsumerFactory.makeTap13YamlConsumerWithoutSubtests();
+---+

 The consumer interprets a TAP Stream and transforms it into a {{{http://tap4j.sourceforge.net/apidocs/org/tap4j/model/TestSet.html}TestSet}} 
 object. A TAP Stream consists of one test set. A test set, by its turn, 
 consists of zero or more test results and exactly one plan. A test set can be 
 determined to have failed or passed.
 
+---+
TestSet testSet = consumer.load(
    "1..2\n" + 
    "ok 1 - no error" + 
    "not ok 2 - io error"
);
System.out.println( "Number of tests found: " + testSet.getNumberOfTestResults() );
System.out.println( "Test Set failed? " + testSet.containsNotOk() );
