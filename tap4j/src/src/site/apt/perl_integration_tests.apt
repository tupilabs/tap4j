Perl Integration Tests

 In version 1.4.6 new tests were created to integrate tap4j and Perl. This is 
 done by using {{{http://search.cpan.org/~patl}Patrick LeBoutiliier}} 
 fantastic metatap script. This is metatap's description from  
 {{{http://search.cpan.org/~patl/metatap-0.01/}CPAN}}.
 
 "metatap is a simple testing tool for TAP producers. It reads TAP from standard 
 input, along with the expected results on the command line. It then produces 
 (and optionally runs) TAP describing how the input TAP was interpreted by 
 TAP::Harness."
 
 If you are building tap4j from source you can execute the tests by running 
 <mvn -e clean test -Pperl-integration>. This command executes a TestNG 6.0 class 
 that creates a TapProducer, dumps its contents to a temporary file and then 
 reads it with metatap.
 
 This test requires having "perl" in PATH, and was created in Windows running 
 Strawberry Perl. So there may have issues running it in different operational 
 systems.
 
 We are happy to announce that tap4j passed in all integration tests :)
